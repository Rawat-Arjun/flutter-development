My First Futter Project-->

Aug 14 2023, 
In this, I made three screens and those are-
a) Register_screen
b) Login_screen
c) Main_screen

In this app, 

i) I used Firebase server for collecting the data of user.
Through firebase , email address and password are collected as user information.

ii) I used Email Validation which is a buildin package of flutter.
through Email Validation, user get warning if he/she did some mistake while enetered their personal information.

iii) I used alert dialog box which pop-up on the screen (with FireBaseAuth exception) through which user got hint what he/she did wrong.

Aug 15 2023,
today, I made app to verify the user by sending the email on his/her email address due to which -
a) app got the user in its database or storage.
b) user knows that he/she successfully verified in the app and now they can login.
